      <h2> The Software Engineering Process </h2>
      <p>
        Consists of:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Methodologies: A sequence of step-by-step approaches that help develop an Information System.
          </li>
          <li>
            Techniques: Processes that the analyst follows to ensure thorough, complete, and comprehensive analysis & design.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools: Computer programs that aid in applying techniques.
          </li>

      <h2> System Analysis & Design </h2>
      <p>
        A subset/semi-process of the entire System Development Process or Life Cycle is Systems Analysis & Design, which is a standard method/development process/procedures used by companies to create and maintain systems that perform basic business functions for themselves or for the clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong> Major Objective: </strong> To improve organizational systems by developing or acquiring software and training employees in its use.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>The Process of Systems Development</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Systems development process:</strong> A set of activities, methods, best practices, deliverables, and automated tools that stakeholders use to develop and maintain IS and software <br />
        A standard set of processes or steps to be followed on any system development project.<br />
        <strong>Systems development methodology: </strong> A formalized approach to the systems development process; a standardized process that includes the activities, methods, best practices, deliverables, and automated tools to be used for information systems development. <br />
        There are many variations on the process, and in order to realize quality and productivity improvements, many organizations have turned to project and process management frameworks such as the Capability Maturity Model.<br />
        Using a consistent process for system development:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Creates efficiencies that allow management to shift resources between projects
          </li>
          <li>
            Produces consistent documentation that reduces lifetime costs to maintain the systems
          </li>
          <li>
            Promotes quality
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>The Capability Maturity Model</h3>
      <p>
        A standardized framework for assessing and improving the maturity level of an organization's information systems development and management processes and products. It consists of five levels of maturity. Each level is a prerequisite for the next level:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Level 1 - Initial:</strong> Sometimes called anarchy or chaos. System development projects follow no prescribed process. Each development team uses its own tools and methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Level 2 - Repeatable:</strong> Project management processes and practices are established to track project costs, schedules, and functionality. Focus is on project management. A system development process is always followed, but it may vary from project to project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Level 3 - Defined:</strong> A standard system development process (sometimes called a 'methodology') is purchased or developed. All projects use a version of this process to develop and maintain information systems and software.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Level 4 - Managed:</strong> Measurable goals for quality and productivity are established.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Level 5 - Optimizing:</strong> The standardized system development process is continuously monitored and improved based on measures and data analysis established in Level 4. Lessons learned are shared across the organization.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Life Cycle versus Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        Most system development processes are derived from a natural <em>system life cycle</em>: The factoring of the lifetime of an IS into two stages:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Systems development - first you build it. At some point, obsolescence occurs, and a system cycles from operation and maintenance to development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Systems operation and maintenance - then you use and maintain it. When a system cycles from development to operation and maintenance, a converstion must take place.
          </li>
        </ol>
        A systems development methodology executes the first stage(systems development) of the system life cycle. Each individual IS has its own system life cycle.<br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Principles for Systems Development</h3>
      <p>
        General principles that should underlie all systems development methodologies:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Get the system users involved
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#prob-solving-approach">Use a problem-solving approach</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Establish phases and activities
          </li>
          <li>
            Document through development
          </li>
          <li>
            Establish standards
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#proj-process-mgmt">Manage the process and projects</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Justify systems as capital investments: <br />
            <em> Cost-effectiveness</em> – The result obtained by striking a balance between the lifetime costs of developing, maintaining, and operating an information system and the benefits derived from that system. Cost-effectiveness is measured by a cost-benefit analysis.<br />
            <em>Strategic information systems plan</em> – A formal strategic plan (3-5 years) for building and improving an information technology infrastructure and the information system applications that use that infrastructure.<br />
            <em>Strategic enterprise plan</em> – A formal strategic plan (3-5 years)  for an entire business that defines its mission, vision, goals, strategies, benchmarks, and measures of progress and achievement. Usually, the strategic enterprise plan is complemented by strategic business unit plans that define how each business unit will contribute to the enterprise plan. The information systems plan is one of those unit-level plans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t be afraid to cancel or revise scope: <br />
            <em>Creeping commitment</em> - A strategy in which feasibility and risks are continuously reevaluated throughout a project. Project budgets and deadlines are adjusted accordingly. <br />
            <em>Risk management</em> - The process of identifying, evaluating, and controlling what might go wrong in a project before it becomes a threat to the successful completion of the project or implementation of the information system. Risk management is drive by risk analysis or assessment.

      <h3> The System Development Life Cycle: </h3>
      <p>
        A framework that describes the activities performed at each stage of a System Development Process
      </p>

      <p id="prob-solving-approach">
        For a system development process, the following general problem-solving steps may be used:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Identify the problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analyze and understand the problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify solution requirements and expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify alternative solutions and choose the best course of action.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design the chosen solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement the chosen solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evaluate the results(If the problem is not solved, return to step 1 or 2 as appropriate).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <img src="" />
      </p>

      <p>
        A simplified development process therefore, may look like this:
        <ul>
          <li>
            System Initiation: The initial planning for a project to define initial business scope, goals, schedule, and budget. Project scope defines the area of the business to be addressed by the project and the goals to be achieved. By establishing a project schedule and budget against the <em> initial </em> scope and goals, you establish a <em> baseline </em> against which all stakeholders can accept the reality that any future changes in scope or goals will impact the schedule and budget. <br />

            Project managers, system analysts, and system owners are the primary stakeholders in a system initiation. <br />

            <em> Deliverables: </em> Business problem statement project plan that establishes the scope, goals, schedule, and budget for solving the problem with a technical solution.
          </li>

          <li>
            System Analysis: The study of a business problem to provide the project team with a more thorough understanding of the problems and needs that triggered the project. <br />
            The scope of the project(defined during initiation), may be studied and analyzed to gain a more detailed understanding of what works, what doesn't, and what's needed. <br />
            Requires working with system users to clearly define business requirements and expectations for any new system that is to be purchased or developed. <br />

            The completion of a system analysis often results in the need to update many of the deliverables produced earlier, during system initiation. The analysis may reveal the need to revise the business scope or project goals. Accordingly, the schedule and budget for the project may need to be revised. Finally, the feasibility of the project itself becomes questionable. The project could be canceled or could proceed to the next phase. <br />

            Project managers, system analysts, and system users are the primary stakeholders in a system analysis. <br />

            <em> Deliverables </em>: Statement of the system users' business requirements, expectations, and priorities for a solution to the problem.
          </li>

          <li>
            System Design: The specification or construction of a technical, computer-based solution for the business requirements identified in a system analysis.(The design might take the form of a working <a href="../info-sys/index.html">prototype</a>) <br />

            During system design we will initially need to explore alternative technical solutions. Once a technical alternative is chosen and approved, the system design phase develops the specifications required to implement the final solution. These will be used to implement required databases, programs, UIs, andnetworks for the IS. <br />

            Project managers, system analysts, and system designers are the primary stakeholders in a system design. <br />

            <em> Deliverables </em>: Technical specifications for a solution that fulfills the business requirements.
          </li>

          <li>
            System Implementation: The construction, installation, testing, and delivery of a system into production, ready for operation. <br />

            Any new hardware and system software are installed and tested. Any purchased application software and databases are installed and configured. Any custom software and databases are constructed using the specifications developed during system design. These components must be individually tested. And the complete system must also be tested. <br />

            After being deployed and placed into operation, the system users must be trained to use the system. And finally, some sort of transition plan from older business processes and IS may have to be implemented. <br />

            Project managers, system analysts, and system designers are the primary stakeholders in a system design. <br />

            <em> Deliverables </em>: Technical hardware and software solution for the business problem according to the technical architecture and specifications.
          </li>

          <li>
            System Support and Continuous Improvement: A change made for system support or improvement Is merely another project, sometimes called a <em> maintenance </em> or <em> enhancement </em> project. Such a project should follow the exact same problem approach defined for any other project.The only difference is the effort and budget required to complete the project. Many of the phases will be completed much more quickly, especially if tbe original stakeholders properly documented the system as initially developed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p id="proj-process-mgmt">
        Any system development process must be managed on a project-by-project basis. The activity of managing a project is referred to as <strong> project management </strong> <br />

        <strong> Project Management</strong>: The activity of defining, planning, directing, monitoring, controlling, and closing a project to develop an acceptable system within the alotted time and budget. <br />

        <strong> Process Management</strong>: The ongoing activity that defines, improves, and coordinates the use of an organization's chosen methodology(the 'process') and standards for all system development projects. It defines the methodology to be used on every project. <br />

        <strong>Process manager application</strong>: An automated tool that helps document and manage a methodology and routes, its deliverables, and quality management standards. It is concerned with administering a single instance of the process as applied to a single project. <br />

        <strong>Project manager application</strong>: An automated tool to help plan system development activities, estimate and assign resources (including people and costs), schedule activities and resources, monitor progress against schedule and budget, control and modify schedule and resources, and report project progress.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Where Do Systems Development Projects Come From?</h3>
      <p>
        System owners and users initiate most projects. The impetus for most projects is some combination of problems, opportunities, and directives:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Problem – an undesirable situation that prevents the organization from fully achieving its purpose, goals, and/or objectives
          </li>
          <li>
            Opportunity – a chance to improve the organization even in the absence of an identified problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Directive - a new requirement that is imposed by management, government, or some external influence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        There are far too many potential system problems. However, the <span id="pieces">PIECES</span> framework may be used to classify problems:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>P</strong>  the need to correct or improve performance
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I</strong>  the need to improve information and data
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>E</strong>  the need to improve economics, control costs, or increase profits
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>C</strong>  the need to improve control or security
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>E</strong>  the need to improve efficiency of people and processes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>S</strong>  the need to improve service to customers, suppliers, partners, employees, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Projects can be planned or unplanned. A <em>planned project</em> is the result of one of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              An <em>information systems strategy plan</em> has examined the business as a whole to identify those system development projects that will return the greatest strategic (long-term) value to the business
            </li>
            <li>
              A <em>business process redesign</em> has thoroughly analyzed a series of business processes to eliminate redundancy and bureaucracy and to improve efficiency and value added. Not it is time to redesign the supporting information system for those redesigned business processes
            </li>
          </ul>
          Projects that are <em>unplanned</em> are triggered by a specific problem, opportunity, or directive that occurs in the course of doing business. <br />
          <em>Steering committee</em> - An administrative body of system owners and information technology executives that prioritizes and approves candidate system development projects.
          <em>Backlog</em> - A repository of project proposals that cannot be funded or staffed because they are a lower priority than those that have been approved for system development.
        </p>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Phases of a Systems Development Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        Most methodologies consists of phases. The number of phases will vary from one methodology to another. These phases are laid out to better define periodic milestones and the deliverables.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Scope Definition: The first phase of a typical project is scope definition. It establishes the size and boundaries of the project, the project vision, any constraints or limitations, the required project participants, and, finally, the budget and schedule.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Problem statement – a statement and categorization of problems, opportunities, and directives; may also include constraints and an initial vision for the solution. Synonyms include <em>preliminary study</em> and <em>feasibility assessment</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                Constraint – any factor, limitation, or restraint that may limit a solution or the problem-solving process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Scope creep – a common phenomenon wherein the requirements and expectations of a project increase, often without regard to the impact on budget and schedule.
              </li>
              <li>
                Statement of work – a contract with management and the user community to develop or enhance an information system; defines vision, scope, constraints, high-level user requirements, schedule, and budget. Synonyms include project charter, project plan, and service-level agreement
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Problem Analysis
          </li>
          <li>
            Requirement Analysis
          </li>
          <li>
            Logical Design: Translates business requirements into system models that depicts only the business requirements and not any possible technical design or implementation of those requirements. Common synonyms include conceptual design and essential design. The phase is technology independent, meaning the pictures illustrate the system independent of any possible technical solution.<br />

            System model – A picture of a system that represents reality or a desired reality. System models facilitate improved communication between system users, system analysts, system designers, and system builders. <br />

            Analysis paralysis – A satirical term coined to describe a common project condition in which excessive system modeling dramatically slows progress toward implementation of the intended system solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Decision Analysis: The purpose of this phase is to identify candidate technical solutions, and analyze those candidate solutions for feasibility. These solutions are evaluated in terms of:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Technical feasibility – Is the solution technically practical? Does our staff have the technical expertise to design and build this solution?
              </li>
              <li>
                Operational feasibility – Will the solution fulfill the users’ requirements? To what degree? How will the solution change the users’ work environment? How do users feel about such a solution?
              </li>
              <li>
                Economic feasibility – Is the solution cost-effective?
              </li>
              <li>
                Schedule feasibility – Can the solution be designed and implemented within an acceptable time?
              </li>
              <li>
                Risk feasibility – What is the probability of a successful implementation using the technology and approach?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Physical Design & Implementation: The opposite of logical design - The translation of business user requirements into a system model that depicts a technical implementation of the users’ business requirements. Common synonyms include technical design or implementation model. <br />
            The two extreme philosophies of physical design are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Design by specification – physical system models and detailed specification are produced as a series of written (or computer-generated) blueprints for construction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design by prototyping – Incomplete but functioning applications or subsystems (called prototypes) are constructed and refined based on feedback from users and other designers.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Construction & Testing
          </li>
          <li>
            Installation & Delivery
          </li>
          <li>
            System Operation and Maintenance: Once the system is placed into operation, it will require ongoing system support – the ongoing technical support for users of a system, as well as the maintenance required to deal with any errors, omissions, or new requirements that may arise.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Cross Life-Cycle Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Cross life-cycle activity: Any activity that overlaps many or all phases of the systems development process. These activities include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fact-Finding: The formal process of using research, interviews, meetings, questionnaires, sampling, and other techniques to collect information about system problems, requirements,and preferences
          </li>
          <li>
            Documentation & Presentation: <br />
            <em>Documentation</em> – The ongoing activity of recording facts and specifications for a systems for current and future reference

      <h2>Alternative Routes and Strategies</h2>

      <p>
        <h3>Sequential versus Iterative Development</h3>
        Waterfall development approach <br />
        Iterative development approach
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>The Model-Driven Development Startegy</h3>
        A system development strategy that emphasizes the drawing of system models to help visualize and analyze problems, define business requirements, and design information systems:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Process modeling – A process-centered technique popularized by the structured analysis and design methodology that used models of business process requirements to derive effective software designs for a system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data modeling – a data-centered technique used to model business data requirements and design database systems that fulfill those requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Object modeling – a technique that attempts to merge the data and process concerns into singular constructs called objects. Object models are diagrams that document a system in terms of its objects and their interactions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>The Rapid Application Development Strategy</h3>
        A system development strategy that emphasizes speed of development through extensive user involvement in the rapid, iterative, and incremental construction of series of functioning prototypes of a system that eventually evolves into the final system.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>The Commercial Application Package Implementation Strategy</h3>
        A software application that can be purchased and customized to meet the business requirements of a large number of organizations or a specific industry. A synonym is commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Request for proposal (RFP) – a formal document that communicates business, technical, and support requirements for an application software package to vendors that may wish to compete for the sale of that application package and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Request for quotation (RFQ) – a formal document that communicates business, technical, and support requirements for an application software package to a single vendor that has been determined as being able to supply that application package and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gap analysis – a comparison of business and technical requirements for a commercial application package against the capabilities and features of a specific commercial application package for the purpose of defining the requirements that cannot be met.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        <h2>Automated Tools and Technology</h2>

        <p>
          <h3>Computer-Assisted Systems Engineering</h3>
          The use of automated software tools that support the drawing and analysis of system models and associated specifications. Some CASE tools also provide prototyping and code generation capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>Application Development Environments</h3>
          An integrated software development tool that provides all the facilities necessary to develop new application software with maximum speed and quality. A common synonym is integrated development environment (IDE)
